# IotWifiCam Client



### Hey there!

Thanks for downloading my app! 

This repo contains code that serves as the client when communicating with the IotWifiCam  
streaming  video content on your phone. 

Therefore, by using this code, you will be able to receive, view and work with the video being recorded
by your phone running the app at a remote location.

### Running the Client Side Code

You can  follow the instructions regarding how to download and run the client code based on 
your platform  choice, or you can follow the tutorial for writing a client here. 

I highly recommend  following the tutorial, since it's only a few steps, and you can manipulate
the client code based on your needs.  That's customization right there, and I think that's really cool.

#### Clone the Repository

First, clone this repo using git command line, as follows:

```
    git clone https://github.com/deshpr/IotWifiCam_Client.git
```

Or you could simply download and extract the .zip file corresponding to this repo.

Now you can chose to run the client side code for a web client ( HTML and Javascript) or python.

#### Running the HTML & JavaScript Client

You'll wanna use this code if you'd like to stream video from your phone to a webpage.

Here's what you'll need to do:

1. Navigate to 'JavaScript Client' directory.

2. Simply open index.html in the web browser of your chosing.

3. A prompt will appear asking you for the IP Address followed by a Port Number to connect to. When you run
   IotWifiCam on your phone, you'll find these details before you start streaming video.
   Enter those details here.

4. If you've started streaming video on the app, you should see the video from your phone on your 
   browser! 
   
How cool is that!
