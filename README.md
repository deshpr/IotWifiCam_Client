# IOtWifiCam Client



### Hey there!

Thanks for downloading my app! 

This repo contains code that serves as the client when communicating with the IotWifiCam  
streaming  video content on your phone. 

Therefore, by using this code, you will be able to receive, view and work with the video being recorded
by your phone running the app at a remote location.
